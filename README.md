# WordFeuder
A tiny little scrabble/wordfeud/words with friends aid to help find words from a set of letters.
It takes a string and finds all the different permutations of that string.
Then it checks to see which of those permutations are in a dictionary read in from a file
and prints them out. Only finds words that use all the letters in the string - should try to make something
that finds smaller words that can be made from the letters as well.
